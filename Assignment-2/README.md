This repository contains my Docker assignment for the Data Engineering course. The assignment demonstrates:

Docker Images & Containers: Building and running containers for various applications.
Docker Compose: Setting up a multi-container environment easily.
Volumes: Persisting data for PostgreSQL databases.
PostgreSQL Integration: Configuring a database container and connecting it with other services.
Practical Commands: Examples of docker run, docker exec, docker compose up, and resource management.

This project helps in understanding how to create, manage, and orchestrate containers in a local development environment.
